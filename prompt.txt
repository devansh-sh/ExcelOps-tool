since we have added these many features and we still need to add more, i think the UI needs to change now. Remove the preview section. I need the preview to be in the menu.. The menu should contain File|Edit|Preset
File: Load File,Show Previews, Export Sheet, Export Workbook.
Edit: Add a sheet, Remove Sheet
Preset: Load Preset, Preset Manager

For the Edit section (Filter|Sort|Manage Rows/Columns|Pivot Table)
Filter: Keep the same features that we already have
Sort: Keep the same features that we have. remove the arrow buttons they do not work and are not required.
Manage Rows/Columns: Merge the COlumns and Calculated columns in one. Do not change how the manage columns works now, just append the calculated columns into this
Pivot Table: remains the same.

Edit Sections should be center Aligned. With Tabbed sections for the sheets.  User should be able to add a sheet with a "+" button like we did earlier. double click on the sheet name to rename

Previes should be in the menu as mentioned above. User should be able to see the previews in a separate tab. The tab should have a dropdown to select a sheet.
Preset manager should be able to handle pivot and calculated columns as well
